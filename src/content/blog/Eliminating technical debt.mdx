## What Technical Debt Actually Is

Technical debt isn't bad code. It's the gap between what you built and what you should have built — accumulated over time through shortcuts, changing requirements, and honest mistakes.

Some debt is intentional: shipping fast to validate an idea. Some is accidental: not knowing better at the time. All of it compounds.

## The 2025 Reality

The tools have changed. What was acceptable technical debt in 2020 is inexcusable in 2025:

- **AI-assisted code review** catches patterns humans miss
- **Infrastructure-as-code** eliminates "works on my machine" problems
- **Type safety** is no longer optional (TypeScript won)
- **Automated testing** is table stakes, not a luxury

The bar has risen. Legacy debt that "wasn't that bad" now actively holds you back.

## The Five Types of Technical Debt

### 1. Architecture Debt

The foundation is wrong. Monolith that should be services. Services that should be a monolith. Wrong database for your access patterns.

**Cost**: Every feature takes 3x longer than it should.

### 2. Dependency Debt

Outdated packages. Security vulnerabilities. Breaking changes waiting to happen.

```bash
# This output should terrify you
npm audit
found 47 vulnerabilities (12 high, 3 critical)
```

**Cost**: Security breaches, forced emergency migrations.

### 3. Testing Debt

No tests. Wrong tests. Slow tests nobody runs.

**Cost**: Fear of refactoring, bugs reaching production.

### 4. Documentation Debt

Tribal knowledge. Outdated wikis. "Ask Sarah, she knows."

**Cost**: Slow onboarding, key-person dependencies.

### 5. Process Debt

Manual deployments. No CI/CD. "We'll automate it later."

**Cost**: Human error, slow release cycles.

## The Elimination Framework

### Step 1: Audit Ruthlessly

Before fixing anything, understand what you have. Score each area:

| Area | Score (1-5) | Impact | Effort |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Architecture | 3 | High | High |
| Dependencies | 2 | High | Low |
| Testing | 4 | Medium | Medium |
| Documentation | 2 | Low | Low |
| Process | 3 | High | Medium |

### Step 2: Prioritize by ROI

Fix high-impact, low-effort items first. Quick wins build momentum and free up resources for bigger projects.

**Usually this means**: Update dependencies → Add CI/CD → Write critical path tests → Then tackle architecture.

### Step 3: Stop Creating New Debt

No amount of cleanup matters if you're adding debt faster than you're removing it.

Implement these guardrails:
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Lint, format, type-check before code enters the repo
- **PR requirements**: Tests, documentation, review
- **Definition of done**: Includes debt assessment

```yaml
# .github/workflows/quality.yml
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run type-check
      - run: npm run test
```

### Step 4: Budget Debt Work

Don't make it a "someday" project. Allocate real time:

- **20% rule**: One day per week for debt reduction
- **Debt sprints**: Dedicated cleanup sprints quarterly
- **Boy Scout rule**: Leave code better than you found it

### Step 5: Measure Progress

Track metrics over time:
- Build time
- Test coverage
- Time to first PR merge (for new engineers)
- Deployment frequency
- Mean time to recovery

## The Compound Effect

Technical debt compounds negatively. But so does quality.

Every piece of debt you eliminate makes the next fix easier. Every test you add makes refactoring safer. Every document you write makes onboarding faster.

Start small. Stay consistent. The codebase you'll have in 12 months will be unrecognizable — in the best way.

## Your First Week

If you're starting from scratch, here's your week one:

**Monday**: Run `npm audit`, update safe dependencies
**Tuesday**: Add pre-commit hooks (ESLint, Prettier)
**Wednesday**: Set up basic CI pipeline
**Thursday**: Write tests for one critical path
**Friday**: Document one undocumented system

Small steps. Compounding returns.
